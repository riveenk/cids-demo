            <h2>How does a Practice Session Work?</h2>
            <p>A typical session would involve a practice debate, a discussion, or skill practices. Schools or teams are
                able to request special support or debates from our trainers. Customised sessions would be planned on
                the discretion of both parties.</p>

            <h2>When and How do I Join Practice?</h2>
            <p>Internal practice sessions are held weekly on Sundays via Zoom. Members will receive access to it when
                they join and the link is available on the members portal. Practice begins at 6:00 PM (GMT +5:30) and
                officially ends around 9:00 PM. Many members use the time afterwards for personal engagement. Whilst we
                do not endorse it, it is a notably popular choice.</p>

            <h2>What is expected from Members?</h2>
            <p>Punctuality and mutual respect are key expectations on members. All members must join with functioning
                microphones, and preferably with functioning cameras. As disagreement is the spirit of debating, we
                cannot avoid it. However, all members must be respectful towards one another and not confuse debate with
                personal interaction.</p>
